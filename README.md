You may need to run: "export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider" before npm run dev to start the localhost

Next update will include:

 - A countdown between every round.
 - Different sound effects for P1 & P2
 - Sound effect on impact.
 - Scores.
 - Bigger Canvas

Bugs I need to work on:
- Not making P2 the winner in draws.
- Better collision.
- The music looping over itself.


Possible features in the future:

- Character select screen.
- New unique characters.
- Choosing between different colors for your character.
- First to 5 frormat.
- Map select screen.
- More maps with unique elements.

- ONLINE??
